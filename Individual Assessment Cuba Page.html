Cuba has won the third position of American countries in gold medals (trailing only the United States and Canada), and has won more medals than any nation in South America. Cuba has yet to have hosted the Olympic Games. Cuba has won the fourth highest total number of medals (after Hungary, Romania, and Poland) of nations that have never hosted the Games.

		<h3> Young, Upcoming Athlete- Robeisy Ramírez||21 Year Old Phenom <br><image src="rob.webp" height="400" width="350"></h3>
		<p>
			This is a high-spirited fighter, very young, but with significant results. At the age of 19 he surprised everybody by winning a title in 2012 London Olympic Games. Before that, he had already climbed to the top of the podium in 2010 Baku Youth World competition and 2011 Guadalajara Pan-American Games. Discipline problems have been an obstacle in the development of Ramírez, as his presence in the national team has been unstable. However, in 2015 Robeisy seems to be more focused and Acebal placed him as the first man in the 56-kilogram division.

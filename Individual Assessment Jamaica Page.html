		</p>

		<h3> History </h3>
		<p>
			Jamaica has the prestigious honor of having the most success per capita of any country world in track and field. This great honor started when Jamaica’s first track Gold Medallists Dr Authur Wint won the 400m in 1948 Olympics. He along other greats Herb McKenley, Leslie Laing, and George Rhoden put Jamaica on the map in one of the greatest relays when the team won the 4 x 400 relay in the 1952 Olympics. Jamaica’s success at the Olympics and international competitions continued through out years with athletes like Donald Quarrie (gold 200m, silver 100m, in the 1976 Olympics), Bert Cameron (silver, 400 relay, 1988), to Grace Jackson (silver, 200m, 1988), to Winthrop Graham (silver, 400m hurdles, 1992), Raymond Stewart, Juliet Cuthbert (silver, 100, 200m, 1992), Deon Hemmings (gold, 400 hurdles, 1996) and perhaps the most popular athlete track Queen Merlene Ottey who has more International and Olympics medal than any other Jamaicans. In the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Jamaica only won 6 Silver Medals and 3 bronze Medals.

		<h3> Best Performance- Usain Bolt<br><image src="usain.webp" height="400" width="350">	</h3>
		<p>
		<hr>
			Usain Bolt has enjoyed an unstoppable career so far, rightfully earning the title of the world's fastest man. But how has he achieved it? Born in Jamaica in 1986, the star's natural speed was noticed at a young age. By 15 he was known as "Lightning Bolt" thanks to his triumph in the 2002 World Junior Championships. Here he won the 200m dash, making him the youngest world junior gold medallist ever. Later that year the IAFF awarded him their Rising Star Award.

Better still, he became the first man in Olympic history to win both the 100m (9.69 seconds) and 200m (19.30 seconds) races in world record times. He also helped smash the 4x100m relay with the Jamaican team in 37.10 seconds. He defended his titles four years later at the London 2012 Olympics, becoming the first man to win gold medals in both the 100m (9.63 seconds) and 200m (19.32 seconds) at a consecutive Olympic Games. Seemingly unstoppable, 29-year-old Bolt made history in the 2016 after winning a third consecutive gold medal for the 100m race at his final Olympic Games in Rio.

		<h3> Past Champion- Merlene Ottey<br><image src="merlene.webp" height="400" width="350"></h3>
		<p>
			Merlene Ottey's very long Olympic career began at the Moscow Games in 1980. She finished sixth with the Jamaican relay team in the final. But it was in the 200m that she shone to take the bronze medal, an Olympic first by a female athlete in her country. Four years later at the Los Angeles Games, she once again excelled, taking two bronze medals, in the 100 and 200m. She again led the 4x100m relay team in the final, which this time finished in eighth place. In 1998 Ottey moved to Slovenia and began training with Slovene coach Srđan Đorđević. There she was still representing Jamaica. However, in May 2002, she became a Slovene citizen, and now resides in Ljubljana, where she represents her new country in international events.

		<p>
			Yohan Blake (born 26 December 1989), is a Jamaican sprinter of the 100-metre and 200-metre sprint races. He won gold at the 100 m at the 2011 World Championships as the youngest 100 m world champion ever, and a silver medal in the 2012 Olympic Games in London in the 100 m and 200 m races for the Jamaican team. He is known by the nickname "The Beast".Blake is the second fastest man ever in both 100 m and 200 m. He is tied with Tyson Gay at 100 m with a personal best of 9.69 seconds as second fastest ever after Usain Bolt. His personal best for the 200 m (19.26 seconds) is the second fastest ever after Bolt. He holds the Jamaican national junior record for the 100 metres, and was formerly the youngest sprinter to have broken the 10-second barrier (at 19 years, 196 days).He is coached by Glen Mills and his training partners are Usain Bolt and Daniel Bailey.

		<h3> Young, Upcoming Athlete- Oblique Seville<br><image src="o.webp" height="400" width="350"></h3>
		<p>
			Oblique Seville, formerly of Holmwood Technical, joined the Calabar High family two years ago and sat out the Championships last year based on the one-year transfer rule. At the recent John Wolmer Speed Fest Meet at the National stadium, he had fans talking for a long period by virtue of a big statement he made in landing the sprint double. However, it was his 100-metre performance that had them in a frenzy. Seville clocked an impressive 10.46 seconds to win and became the fastest schoolboy this season in the event, surpassing teammate Taylor, who clocked 10.50 seconds at the Wint/McKenley meet. In so doing, the Manchester man will definitely run the event for his new team at Champs. Seville, who came to Calabar with a personal best of 10.89 seconds when he finished sixth in the Class Two 100 metres at Champs in 2017, is happy to be representing his new alma mater and is looking forward to competing at Champs 2019.

The Bahamas Olympic Committee sent a total of 28 athletes, 19 men and 9 women, to the Games, participating only in athletics, swimming, and rowing. Eleven of them had previously competed in London 2012, with Chris Brown leading the men's 4 × 400 m relay squad for the nation's title defense at his fifth consecutive Olympics. Other notable athletes from the Bahamian team featured triple jumper and Beijing 2008 bronze medalist Leevan Sands, swimmer Arianna Vanderpool-Wallace, who rounded out the top eight from London in the women's 50 m freestyle, and sprinter Shaunae Miller, who eventually served as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.
